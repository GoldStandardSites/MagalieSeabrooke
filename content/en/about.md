# About Section
about1__heading: "Passionatly Helping Families"
about1__desc: "Magalie Seabrooke understands first-hand the challenges and concerns that come with parenting and planning for the future. Recruited by C.S.T. Consultants, Inc. in 2003, when, as a then-single mom, she opened a C.S.T. RESP for her 4-week-old daughter, Magalie knew she was on the right career path, and forged ahead with a mission to change the world. 
<br></br>
Fiercely devoted to transforming lives through positive change, this now veteran C.S.T. scholarship plan representative, devoted wife and mother of three, is passionate in her conviction that every child is entitled to an education, that every child has the right to reach for, and achieve their dreams, and to design a future on their own terms. She believes that the greatest gifts parents can give their children are the resources that will set them on the path to accomplishing their goals, and she is committed to providing them with the best strategies and tools to make that happen.  
<br></br>
In both life and work, Magalie has dedicated herself to building authentic relationships, based on mutual trust, and a genuine interest in learning about the people she meets. Nowhere does this come through more clearly than when she sits down with parents to talk about their kids, and the financial needs related to their education. She sincerely cares about her clients and her warm, genuine and compassionate personality immediately puts people at ease. Her in-depth knowledge of the market, the C.S.T. RESP, and her knack for explaining its benefits in a tangible and accessible way, provides clients with the confidence to know they’ve put their trust in the right person."
about2__desc: "Constantly striving to push her limits, and to giving of herself in all spheres of her life, Magalie believes in working hard to make the world a better place, which she would say has been at the root of her success. In addition to her role as a busy wife, mom of three, and full-time C.S.T. representative, Magalie is committed to her community, running a summer day camp and volunteering as a soccer coach. 
<br></br>
She also understands first-hand the benefits of investing in your children. Magalie’s eldest daughter is now 17, started CEGEP in the fall, with a bright future on the horizon, thanks in part to the investment made by her mother 17 years ago. "
