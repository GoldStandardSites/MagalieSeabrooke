service1: "What is an RESP?"
service1_desc: "A registered education savings plan (RESP) is a savings vehicle that allows subscribers such as parents, grandparents, friends and other family members to save for the post-secondary education of a child or other beneficiaries. Today's job market demands higher education and specialized skills. An RESP is a great way to proactively save for your child's education so that when you are ready to start it, you can help them finance it.
<br></br>
Your RESP is registered with the Canada Revenue Agency. Although your contributions are not deductible from taxable income, they continue to accumulate tax free until your child or other beneficiaries need the funds. RESPs offer an additional feature that sets them apart from other registered accounts and other portfolios in the form of government grants."

service2: "How can an RESP help you save?"

service2_desc: "Opening an RESP can help you save for your child's education, but that's not all. Here are some other benefits you get when you open an RESP:
<ul>
<li><strong>Government grants</strong> - You get government grants like the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) and provincial grants (depending on where you live) that are not available in a registered retirement savings plan (RESP) or a tax-free savings account (TFSA).</li>
<li><strong>Tax-deferred growth</strong> - You can earn tax-deferred income. This income may be taxable at the hands of your child who, because he is a student, will pay little or no tax.</li>
<li><strong>Peace of mind</strong> - You can rest assured that when your child is ready for post-secondary education, you will be able to help them finance it.</li>
</ul>"
